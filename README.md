This project is many things: the skeleton of a website for my friends that own a reptile breeding company but also want me to make it a wedding website, a patience tester, an embodiment of my weird sense of humor. Once I realized that it wasn't a real live website and my marketing skills were not for hire, I was able to have a lot more fun with this. Unfortunately I lost 99% of my project and had to start over. It's not nearly as pretty, but it does have the features needed.
FEATURES INCLUDED:
- The navbar switches from a vertical stack on mobile devices to a horizontal display on larger devices. There are also two pages that have a single column layout that expands to two columns on larger devices: the "home" page and the "news" page. I did this because code that pulls their FaceBook feed came from FB and seems to have weird permissions: it only works on some devices and in some browsers. It is not reliable enough to show the CSS repositioning.
- On the "News" tab, there's an animation of falling snakes.
- On the "About Us" tab there's a snake game.
- On the "Contact" tab you can find a form to fill out that validates via Javascript.
