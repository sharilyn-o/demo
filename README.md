This project is many things: the skeleton of a website for my friends that own a reptile breeding company but also want me to make it a wedding website, a patience tester, an embodiment of my weird sense of humor. Once I realized that it wasn't a real live website and my marketing skills were not for hire, I was able to have a lot more fun with this. Unfortunately I lost 99% of my project and had to start over. It's not nearly as pretty, but it does have the features needed.
FEATURES INCLUDED:
- The navbar switches from a vertical stack on mobile devices to a horizontal display on larger devices.
- On the "News" tab, the feed shifts from one column to two when viewed on a larger device instead of a mobile device.
Also on the "News" tab, there's an animation of falling snakes and an attempted pull of their Facebook feed. When viewed off of Dev Tools more of it is apparent but only the header is in this view...
On the "About Us" tab there's a snake game.
On the "Contact" tab you can find a form to fill out that validates via Javascript.
